in Guantanamo
in the bathrooms of low-rent NYC nightclubs
on the internet
at Buckingham Palace
in a grim Baltimore suburb
in Benghazi
in the White House basement
near your kids' school
while you sleep
on the set of Breaking Bad
in the Ecuadorian embassy
in a body scanner
on Twitter
on Facebook
in geostationary orbit
on Snapchat
on a couch in the Oval Office
on the Senate floor
at Denver International Airport
at your parents' place
in the Empire State Building
at Twitter's HQ
under a flyover
in Prince's hot tub
on a luxury cruise
