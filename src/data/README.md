## Custom Wordlists

Put your own wordlist data (1 item per line) in [data](https://github.com/konsumer/randopeep/tree/master/src/data) to have it added to the data-stack.

Run `npm run build` to compile your wordlist into JSON, and into randopeeps.

It doesn't have to be single words, just 1 item per line.
