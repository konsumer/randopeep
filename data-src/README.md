## Custom Wordlists

Put your own wordlist data (1 item per line) in [data-src/wordlists](https://github.com/konsumer/randopeep/tree/master/data-src/wordlists) to have it added to the data-stack.

Run `grunt` to compile your wordlist into JSON.

It doesn't have to be single words, just 1 item per line.
